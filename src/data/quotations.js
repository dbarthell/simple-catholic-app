    yearLabel: "c. 1259–1265",
    quote: "Consequently, it is impossible for the truth of faith to be contrary to principles known by natural reason.",
    source: "Summa Contra Gentiles, Book I, Ch. 7",
    context: "Written partly as a manual for missionaries engaging with Islamic and Jewish philosophy, this work argues systematically that reason and revelation cannot contradict each other, since both originate in God, who is Truth itself."

    work: "Summa Contra Gentiles",
    yearWritten: 1262,
    yearLabel: "c. 1259–1265",
    quote: "Because philosophy arises from awe, a philosopher is bound in his way to be a lover of myth and poetic fable. Poets and philosophers are alike in being big with wonder.",

    context: "Aquinas, synthesizing Aristotle with Christian revelation, celebrates the contemplative dimension of human reason. Wonder at beauty and mystery is not opposed to rigorous inquiry but is its very source."

    source: "Summa Theologica, Part II-II, Q. 1",

    source: "Summa Theologica, Preface to Part II",
    context: "The opening of the moral section of the Summa sets out the threefold structure of Christian ethics: creed, charity, and commandment — corresponding to the Apostles' Creed, the Our Father, and the Decalogue."

    quote: "The things that are of God are knowable to us in two ways. First, as far as the power of natural reason can reach. Second, by divine revelation.",
    source: "Summa Theologica, Part I, Q. 1, Art. 1",
    context: "In the very first article of the Summa, Aquinas poses the question of whether theology is necessary alongside philosophy. His answer establishes the harmony between the two orders of knowledge."

    source: "Fifteen Sermons Preached Before the University of Oxford, Sermon 10",

    source: "Fifteen Sermons Preached Before the University of Oxford, Sermon 15",

    yearWritten: 1852,
    yearLabel: "1852",
    quote: "A University is not a birthplace of poets or of immortal authors, of founders of schools, leaders of colonies, or conquerors of nations. It does but fulfil its function when it trains good members of society.",
    source: "The Idea of a University, Discourse V",
    context: "Delivering these lectures to establish a Catholic university in Dublin, Newman articulated a vision of liberal education as the formation of persons capable of thought — not mere specialists. The work remains a classic of educational philosophy."

    source: "Apologia Pro Vita Sua, Part IV",

    source: "Apologia Pro Vita Sua, Part IV",
    context: "Newman's account of his conversion is notable for its psychological honesty. He refused to pretend that conversion was a merely rational process, insisting on the role of conscience, moral intuition, and personal encounter with holiness."

    source: "A Grammar of Assent, Ch. VIII",
    context: "Newman's most philosophical work examines how ordinary people arrive at genuine religious certainty without formal proofs. He argues that the 'illative sense' — a trained faculty of judgment — guides the whole person to assent."

    source: "A Grammar of Assent, Ch. V",
    context: "Newman elevates conscience to a near-sacramental status: it is not merely a social convention or internalized rule, but the voice of God speaking in the depths of the personal subject — the foundation of his whole religious epistemology."

    quote: "I have to discourse on certitude in religious matters; and I begin by asking where certitude is to be found anywhere.",
    source: "A Grammar of Assent, Ch. VI",
    context: "Newman begins his investigation not by asserting religious certainty but by questioning the grounds of all human certainty, showing that faith is not epistemically inferior to our most secure ordinary beliefs."
